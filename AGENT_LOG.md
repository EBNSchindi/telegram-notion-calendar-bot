### [2025-08-03 21:30] - python-generator
**Task**: Fix Notion sort field error for shared databases
**Status**: ✅ Success
**Context7 Used**: No
**Output**: 
- Modified: /src/services/notion_service.py
- Modified: /src/services/partner_sync_service.py
- Lines of code: ~50 (modified)
- Key features:
  - Implemented dynamic sort property detection (tries Startdatum, Datum, Date)
  - Added fallback to unsorted queries if no valid sort property found
  - Added None checks for get_appointments() returns throughout partner sync
  - Made the system resilient to both old and new database schemas
**Integration Points**:
- Uses: Existing NotionService and error handling patterns
- Exposes: Backward-compatible get_appointments() method
**Complexity**: Medium
**Test Coverage Needed**: 70%
**Documentation Needed**: No - bug fix
**Next Agent**: test-engineer to verify sort property fallback works correctly
**Notes**: 
  - The fix handles databases using either "Datum" or "Startdatum" as date fields
  - Gracefully degrades to unsorted queries if no recognized date field exists
  - All calls to get_appointments() now handle potential None returns
  - Maintains full backward compatibility with existing code
**Duration**: 15 minutes
