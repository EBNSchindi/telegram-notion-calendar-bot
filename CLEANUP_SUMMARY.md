- ✅ `htmlcov/` - Coverage HTML reports
- ✅ `coverage.xml` - Coverage XML report
- ✅ `bot.log` - Log file

#### Backup & Temporary Files
- ✅ `src/utils/input_validator.py.bak` - Backup file
- ✅ Empty directories: `data/`, `coordination/`, `.benchmarks`

#### Duplicate Code Files
- ✅ `src/services/combined_appointment_service_refactored.py` - Unused refactored version
- ✅ `src/services/notion_service_refactored.py` - Unused refactored version

### 🔧 Optimizations

#### Dependencies
- ✅ Removed duplicate testing dependencies from `requirements.txt`
- ✅ Kept all testing dependencies in `requirements-dev.txt` only

#### Docker
- ✅ Optimized Dockerfile to only copy necessary files
- ✅ Improved Docker build caching strategy
- ✅ Reduced image size by excluding unnecessary files

### 📈 Results

- **Cleaner Structure**: Removed all redundant and temporary files
- **Better Organization**: Documentation properly categorized
- **Reduced Size**: Eliminated unnecessary files from repository
- **Improved Build**: Optimized Docker image and dependencies

### 🎯 Recommendations

1. **Git Cleanup**: Run `git add -A && git commit -m "Clean up project structure"` to commit changes
2. **Verify .gitignore**: The existing `.gitignore` already covers most cleanup patterns
3. **Regular Maintenance**: Periodically check for and remove generated files
4. **Documentation**: Keep active documentation in root or `/docs`, archive completed work

The project is now cleaner, more organized, and ready for efficient development!
